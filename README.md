## 🚀 Who Am I?

A **Linux-first student and developer** who prefers understanding systems over blindly using them.

I like working close to the machine — exploring how operating systems, software, and tools actually function beneath the surface. I learn best by **building things**, **breaking them**, and then **fixing them properly**.

I enjoy game development as a creative outlet, programming as a craft, and philosophy as a way to question *why* we build things the way we do.

## 🧠 What I’m Into

- 🐧 Linux and system-level thinking  
- 💻 Programming and software fundamentals  
- 🎮 Game development (logic, mechanics, story)  
- 🧠 Consciousness, philosophy, and deep ideas  
- ✍️ Writing stories, lore, and long-form concepts  
- 🛠️ Customization, experimentation, and optimization  

I like mixing **logic + creativity** — code that works and ideas that mean something.

## 🧩 How I Learn

I don’t rush learning. I focus on:
- understanding fundamentals first  
- reading documentation instead of shortcuts  
- experimenting until things make sense  
- learning by doing, not memorizing  

I’m fine with slow progress if it’s real progress.

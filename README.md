# 💫 About Me:
# Hi, I'm Raphael 👋<br><br>I’m a student, developer, and someone who genuinely enjoys learning how things work at a deeper level. I like building software, breaking systems, fixing them again, and slowly understanding the ideas behind them rather than just using tools on the surface.<br><br>I’ve been daily-driving Linux for a long time (mostly Arch), and that experience shaped how I think about computers, software, and learning in general. I don’t just like getting things done — I like knowing *why* they work.<br><br>---<br><br>## What I’m interested in<br><br>I enjoy working across different areas instead of sticking to just one thing.<br><br>- 🐧 Linux and operating systems  <br>- 💻 Programming and software development  <br>- 🎮 Game development (mainly using Godot, C#, and GDScript)  <br>- 🧠 Philosophy, consciousness, and deep thinking  <br>- ✍️ Writing stories, lore, and world-building  <br>- 🛠️ Customization, experimentation, and learning from scratch  <br><br>I like mixing technical work with creativity. Sometimes that means code, sometimes stories, sometimes systems that feel almost philosophical in nature.<br><br>---<br><br>## How I learn and work<br><br>I learn best by doing things myself. I prefer:<br>- reading documentation instead of just tutorials  <br>- experimenting and failing until something clicks  <br>- understanding fundamentals before using abstractions  <br>- building small things and slowly expanding them  <br><br>I don’t rush learning. I’m fine with taking time if it means I actually understand what I’m doing.<br><br>---<br><br>## Game development<br><br>Game development is one of my favorite creative outlets. I enjoy:<br>- writing gameplay logic  <br>- designing mechanics and systems  <br>- thinking about story, atmosphere, and meaning  <br>- blending code with emotion and narrative  <br><br>I like games that feel thoughtful, slightly dark, emotional, or philosophical rather than just flashy.<br><br>---<br><br>## Writing and ideas<br><br>I also enjoy writing stories and concepts. I like:<br>- long-term plots  <br>- character growth  <br>- hidden truths and twists  <br>- themes around time, identity, morality, and humanity  <br><br>A lot of my ideas are inspired by anime, light novels, and philosophical sci-fi.<br><br>---<br><br>## How I think<br><br>I’m naturally curious and reflective. I ask a lot of “why” questions — sometimes about code, sometimes about life. I like ideas that challenge common thinking and push me to see things differently.<br><br>I enjoy solitude, deep focus, and meaningful conversations more than surface-level noise.<br><br>---<br><br>## Currently<br><br>Right now, I’m:<br>- learning more about systems and low-level concepts  <br>- working on personal and experimental projects  <br>- improving my skills step by step  <br>- exploring ideas related to consciousness and perception  <br>- trying to grow as both a developer and a person  <br><br>---<br><br>## Final note<br><br>This GitHub is a place where I learn in public, experiment freely, and slowly build things I care about. Some projects may be messy, some unfinished, but all of them represent growth.<br><br>If you’re someone who likes learning, building, and thinking deeply — you’ll probably feel at home here.<br><br>Thanks for stopping by.<br>
